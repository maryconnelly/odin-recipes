<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Whenever I ask my husband what he would like added to our meal plan for the week, the answer is always the same (honestly, I don't know why I bother asking him anymore at all).  White chicken chili.  The journey to find the the ideal combination and ratios of ingredients has finally produced this particularly delicious and simple recipe. Easy to throw together on the stove or crockpot, this version has always been a crowd-pleaser. And my husband would like me to advise you that for best results, toppings must include crushed tortilla chips, avocado, and, of course, hot sauce. Enjoy! </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2 cups cooked, shredded chicken</li>
        <li>2 (15.5 oz.) cans white beans <em>drained and rinsed</em></li>
