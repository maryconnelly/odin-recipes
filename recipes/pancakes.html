            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Every Sunday morning as a kid, I would wake up to the sound of Nat King Cole crooning in the living room and the smell of sausage and pancakes frying on the griddle in the kitchen. This was a tradition I knew I wanted to keep alive when I had kids.  I worked on finding the perfect recipe every Sunday morning for months before we had kids and I am proud to say I think I have found a recipe that could be handed down for generations to come. </p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li> 
                    <li>1 Tbsp sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>1.5 cups milk <em>plus more to thin the batter, as needed</em></li>
                    <li>3 Tbsp melted butter </li>
        
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix all ingredients. </li>
                    <li>Pour about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of batter onto a hot griddle. When you see bubbles popping and the edges begin to crisp, flip the pancake.  </li>
                    <li>Repeat until you've used all the batter.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot with butter, berries, and/or syrup.</li>
                </ol>
